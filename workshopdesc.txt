[h1]Spicetrauma - Spiced-Up Artifact Descriptions 1.0.1[/h1]
is a simple mod that that unifies the naming scheme of alien artifacts, as well as changing the descriptions of various other alien items to be more interesting or in-line with others.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]What exactly does this mod do?[/h2]
Changes the names of the three non-scientist artifacts to have the names of scientists, changes the descriptions of [i]all[/i] large and minor artifacts to be more interesting, and changes the descriptions of the Oxygenite Shard and Sulphurite Shard to be more in-line with the other alien materials.

Did this mostly because the artifact descriptions bored me; figured it'd be nice for the hints at their effects to be a bit more subtle, especially to newer players. In the case of the minor artifacts, it helps me remember what they yield when deconstructed. The shards are self-explanatory; why do they have no proper descriptions while Physicorium and others do?

Comes in both English and Latin-American Spanish, because those are the languages I speak. Offers to help translate into other languages are greatly appreciated!

[h3]All of my mods are open-source![/h3]

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
This is a relatively unintrusive mod that shouldn't break anything by itself. It can be added or removed during a campaign at any time without issue.
Descriptions are changed through the translation file rather than the item itself; any mod that edits the item should retain this mod's description, unless the mod edits that too and is above this mod in the list. There should be no breakage whatsoever.

[h3][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3218219821]Artifacts and Ruins Enhanced[/url][/h3]
Overrides the descriptions for all large artifacts in both English and LA Spanish (despite the latter still being English?), as well as their names despite them being unchanged from vanilla. Takes a more straightforward, informational approach to descriptions of its effects - place above this mod if you want its changes, place below if you want this mod's changes.

[h2]Can you add cross-mod support for X?[/h2]
Potentially, though I've yet to dabble in pretty much any content mod, and am not familiar with what's out there either. If you have a mod that you want me to add support for, consider reaching out to ask.

I have plans to go into support for More Artifacts and Artifacts Extended, and potentially Artifacts and Ruins Enhanced as a separate compat-patch mod. This will likely happen after I finish my current campaign and get to play through these mods myself.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
As this is a very small mod, there's not much to do except keep on the lookout for bugs and cross-mod support opportunities. As such, it will only get updated when needed.

[b]CURRENT FOCUS:[/b] future cross-mod support
[b]CURRENT STATUS:[/b] being passively maintained
